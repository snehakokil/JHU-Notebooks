Mountain Bliss,"The ambience was a bit dull, with poorly maintained furniture and dim lighting. Surprisingly, the service was warm and prompt. The food was average and lacked seasoning, which was a letdown.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
Urban Escape,"The interiors and vibe of the hotel were fantastic, giving a modern and luxurious feel. Service was top-notch with attentive staff. However, the food left a lot to be desired—it was bland and overpriced.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
City Comfort Inn,"The hotel was neat and clean, but the ambience felt generic and nothing special. Service was poor, with rude staff at the reception. The food, however, was delicious and worth every penny.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Paradise Heights,"When we arrived, the ambience took our breath away—impeccable decor, soothing music in the lobby, and a cozy vibe in the lounge area. It was a picture-perfect setting. Unfortunately, our excitement fizzled out quickly. The staff at the front desk seemed overwhelmed and curt. It took 30 minutes just to check in. The dinner experience was mixed—the starters were heavenly, but the main course was lukewarm and lacked flavor.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Seaside Retreat,"The ambience was nothing short of magical. The open-air dining area facing the ocean was dreamy, especially during sunset. Sadly, this was overshadowed by the sluggish service. We had to remind the waiter three times to bring water! On the brighter side, the food was a masterpiece—the seafood curry was perfectly spiced, and the desserts were melt-in-your-mouth good. If only the service matched the quality of everything else.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Green Valley Inn,"Walking into the hotel, I was immediately struck by how dated and uninspiring the decor was. It felt like stepping into the '90s, with faded carpets and dim, flickering lights. To my surprise, the staff was incredibly courteous and attentive—they really tried to make our stay comfortable. The food was another story—it wasn’t outright bad, but it lacked any wow factor. Even the chef’s special was just okay.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
Sapphire Suites,"The hotel is a blend of modern luxury and traditional charm, and it shows in every corner, from the elegant lobby to the rooftop garden. The staff was warm, courteous, and seemed to genuinely care about guests. Sadly, the food was far from what I expected. My pasta was overcooked, and the flavors were inconsistent. Even the dessert, a chocolate lava cake, was cold in the middle. Such a shame given the overall experience!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
Cozy Haven,"At first glance, the hotel seemed like the perfect hideaway—beautifully lit paths, greenery everywhere, and a peaceful vibe. But the cracks began to show quickly. The receptionist seemed annoyed and barely acknowledged us. Dinner was a disaster—the chicken was undercooked, and the soup tasted like plain water. On the bright side, the ambience helped us unwind after a long day of travel.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Serenity Stays,"The moment we entered, the ambience hit all the right notes—a charming mix of rustic wooden furniture and soft, warm lighting that felt so inviting. We even spent an hour in the reading nook near the fireplace, which was delightful. But then came the service debacle. We called housekeeping twice for fresh towels and received them only after three hours. Dinner was a pleasant surprise—the grilled salmon was cooked to perfection, and the side of garlic mashed potatoes was heavenly. If they could fix their service, this place would be a gem!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Golden Horizon Hotel,"Walking into the hotel, I felt like royalty—the high ceilings, grand chandeliers, and aromatic candles created such an opulent vibe. Sadly, the charm ended there. The staff at the restaurant seemed understaffed and distracted, leaving us waiting for ages. To add to the frustration, the food was an emotional rollercoaster: the starters were divine, but the main course—an overcooked steak—was a complete disappointment. At least the ambience made for great Instagram photos, but I left feeling this place doesn’t live up to its potential.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
The Urban Nest,"This place truly felt like a hidden oasis in the middle of the bustling city. The lush greenery and open courtyard were soothing, and the sound of a little water fountain added to the charm. Sadly, the staff seemed either untrained or uninterested—we had to ask multiple times for assistance, and their responses were lukewarm at best. Food, however, was fantastic! The chef clearly put love into every dish—our paneer tikka and chocolate mousse dessert were flawless. Overall, the ambience and food made up for the poor service.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Sunset Bay Resorts,"I was so excited to stay here because of the glowing reviews about its beachfront location, and it didn’t disappoint. Watching the sunset from my room’s balcony was a dream come true. But things took a turn for the worse when we tried the in-house restaurant. The menu sounded promising, but my prawn curry was bland and the rice undercooked. On top of that, the staff seemed utterly clueless about handling even simple requests. I have to give credit to the ambience, though—falling asleep to the sound of waves was unforgettable.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Tranquil Meadows,"The vibe here is like a countryside escape—calm, serene, and absolutely refreshing. The rooms had a minimalist aesthetic that I personally loved. The staff was polite and extremely accommodating—they helped us book last-minute transport and even packed snacks for our day trip. As for the food, it was a hit-and-miss situation. The breakfast spread was delightful, but dinner was a letdown—the pasta was overly creamy and lacked seasoning. Still, the peaceful atmosphere and great service made the trip worthwhile.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
Blue Lagoon Retreat,"The hotel had an otherworldly charm—the lagoon-facing rooms offered breathtaking views of the turquoise waters, and the outdoor seating area with soft lantern lighting was straight out of a movie scene. However, the service was an absolute nightmare. It took almost an hour for the staff to deliver our luggage to the room, and the concierge barely had answers to basic queries about nearby attractions. The food, though, saved the day. Their seafood platter was the highlight of our trip, fresh and bursting with flavors. Overall, a bittersweet experience.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Velvet Horizon Suites,"The hotel markets itself as luxury redefined, and while the interiors and furnishings were undoubtedly lavish, the overall experience didn’t match. The ambience felt cold and impersonal—too much marble and not enough warmth. Service was abysmal—we called for room service, and it never even arrived. The food was decent but not memorable; the Caesar salad was soggy, and the soup was lukewarm. I wanted to love this place, but its lack of warmth in every sense left me underwhelmed. Definitely not worth the price tag.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Maplewood Grove,"This place is a hidden treasure! The ambience is homely, with wooden accents and soft lighting, making it feel like a cozy mountain lodge. The staff was genuinely kind and went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. They even surprised us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Speaking of food, the dinner was divine—the butter chicken melted in our mouths, and the naan was fresh and fluffy. If I had to nitpick, the breakfast buffet could’ve had more variety, but this place will always hold a special spot in our hearts.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Sapphire Dawn Inn,"At first, I thought this hotel would be the perfect getaway—the photos looked stunning. But reality fell short. The ambience lacked personality, with mismatched furniture and dim lighting that felt depressing. The staff wasn’t rude but seemed indifferent; it took multiple follow-ups to get our extra pillows. The food was a mix—breakfast pastries were delicious, but the dinner was a disaster; my steak was overcooked, and the vegetables were soggy. While the stay wasn’t terrible, I wouldn’t recommend it to someone looking for a memorable experience.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Golden Woods Resort,"Golden Woods truly lives up to its name—the ambience was lush and serene, with trees and greenery surrounding every corner. It was like stepping into a natural sanctuary. The service staff deserves a standing ovation—they were attentive without being intrusive and even helped us arrange a surprise candlelit dinner under the stars. As for the food, the chef’s creations were an absolute delight—every dish was flavorful, and the desserts were to die for. I left with a full heart and a full stomach. Can’t wait to come back again soon!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Alpine Bliss Hotel,"Nestled in the hills, this hotel promised a serene retreat, and it mostly delivered. The wooden cabins surrounded by misty pines were straight out of a fairytale, and the crackling fireplace in the lounge added a cozy charm. However, the service left much to be desired. The reception staff seemed overwhelmed, and our check-in process took almost an hour. The restaurant was the silver lining—the mushroom risotto was creamy and delightful, and the freshly baked bread was a treat. If only the service matched the ambience, this place could have been perfect.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Crystal Waters Resort,"We had high hopes for our romantic getaway, but the hotel turned out to be a mixed bag. The lagoon-facing rooms had stunning views, but the ambience inside was underwhelming—the decor felt dated, and the lighting was too dim for my liking. The staff, on the other hand, were delightful! They went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and even arranged a surprise anniversary cake. The food was hit-and-miss—the seafood chowder was heavenly, but the grilled fish was bland and overcooked. I’d come back for the service but with lowered expectations.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Positive, Food: Negative}"
The Jasmine Courtyard,"Walking into this hotel felt like stepping into a Mediterranean dream. The courtyard was filled with jasmine vines, and the subtle fragrance was enchanting. The ambience was serene, perfect for unwinding. Service, unfortunately, was mediocre—though polite, the staff often seemed forgetful. We had to remind them twice about our room cleaning. The food was the highlight of our stay! From the creamy hummus to the perfectly spiced kebabs, every bite transported us to another world. Overall, a great experience, though better service would elevate it further.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Moonlit Harbor Inn,"This hotel had so much potential—the location by the harbor was idyllic, and the view of the moonlit sea was mesmerizing. But the service completely ruined the experience. From the unfriendly front desk staff to the careless housekeeping, it felt like no one cared about the guests. The food was equally disappointing—my lobster bisque was watery, and the pasta was overly salty. The only saving grace was the stunning view, which made me wish the rest of the experience had matched its beauty. Sadly, I won’t be coming back anytime soon.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Evergreen Haven,"From the moment we arrived, Evergreen Haven lived up to its name—a true sanctuary surrounded by lush greenery. The wooden pathways and blooming flowers made for a tranquil escape. The staff was incredibly attentive, greeting us with welcome drinks and ensuring every little detail was perfect. The food was exceptional—don’t miss their signature herb-crusted lamb chops and the decadent chocolate lava cake. This place is a slice of paradise. I can’t wait to return for another rejuvenating stay!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Ocean Breeze Resort,"The location is unbeatable, right by the beach with stunning sunrise views. But that’s about the only good thing I can say about this place. The ambience felt run-down, with peeling paint and creaky furniture. The service was frustratingly slow—our room wasn’t ready even after the check-in time, and we waited an extra two hours. To top it off, the food was appalling. The seafood platter was cold, and the pasta was soggy. For such a prime location, this hotel really needs to step up its game.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Sunset Bliss Inn,"I rarely write reviews, but this stay deserves it! The ambience was simply magical, with fairy lights adorning the outdoor dining area and soft jazz playing in the background. The staff was courteous and seemed genuinely happy to assist, which made our experience even better. And the food? Absolutely spectacular! Their creamy mushroom soup and caramelized apple tart are still on my mind. A perfect stay for a romantic getaway—I couldn’t have asked for more.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Serenity Grove,"This hotel had so much promise but failed to deliver in almost every way. The ambience was lifeless—the lounge felt like a waiting room with no personality. The staff were robotic, doing the bare minimum without any warmth or effort. And don’t even get me started on the food—the burger was dry, the fries were soggy, and the dessert was clearly store-bought. Honestly, it felt more like a budget motel than the luxury experience it claimed to be.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Whispering Pines Lodge,"A mixed experience at best. The wooden cottages nestled in the forest created a peaceful ambience that was truly one-of-a-kind. However, the staff seemed disinterested and lacked basic hospitality skills—we had to call three times to get fresh towels. The food wasn’t great either; the pizza was undercooked, and the salad seemed stale. The beautiful surroundings couldn’t completely make up for the lackluster service and mediocre meals. A disappointing stay overall.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Azure Peaks Resort,"Azure Peaks provided a rollercoaster of emotions. The view from the balcony was breathtaking, but that’s where the magic ended. The staff was rude and unhelpful—they refused to accommodate a simple request for an extra blanket, claiming they were ‘out of stock.’ The food wasn’t much better; the fish was overcooked, and the dessert was overly sweet. If you’re looking for a place with stunning views and nothing else, this might work for you, but I wouldn’t recommend it otherwise.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Golden Horizon Hotel,"At first glance, the hotel seemed promising with its impressive lobby and welcoming decor. However, that’s where the charm ended. The rooms were dusty, with stained carpets that screamed for a deep cleaning. The staff was indifferent to our requests, ignoring even basic courtesy like smiling or offering assistance. Surprisingly, the food was delightful—perfectly seasoned steaks and the best crème brûlée I’ve had in years. It’s a shame the lackluster service and poor upkeep overshadowed the excellent dining experience.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Sapphire Lagoon Resort,"The stunning lagoon view and beautifully lit infinity pool made for an unforgettable ambience. The service was equally exceptional—every staff member seemed genuinely invested in ensuring we had a great time. From arranging a private dinner to promptly addressing any concerns, they left no stone unturned. And oh, the food! The grilled prawns and handcrafted cocktails were culinary masterpieces. If you’re looking for a perfect blend of luxury and hospitality, this is it. We’re already planning our next visit!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Rustic Meadows Inn,"I’ve stayed at many countryside inns, but this one was a disappointment. The ambience was dull and uninspired, with mismatched furniture and flickering lights in the hallway. The staff was unhelpful, taking ages to respond to simple queries, and they seemed annoyed when asked for assistance. The food was the worst part—cold soup, overcooked chicken, and stale bread. A complete disaster from start to finish. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, even as a last resort.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Celestial Bay Retreat,"What a lovely little retreat! The serene bayfront location, combined with minimalist yet elegant decor, created an atmosphere of absolute tranquility. The service was top-notch—the staff anticipated our needs before we even had to ask. As for the food, the chef outdid himself with every dish. The lobster ravioli and molten chocolate cake were simply divine. This place gets a 10/10 from me and is an absolute must-visit for anyone seeking a luxurious escape by the sea.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Maplewood Lodge,"My stay here left me conflicted. On one hand, the ambience was cozy, with wooden interiors and a fireplace that gave it a rustic charm. However, the service was painfully slow—it took 45 minutes to get extra towels, and the housekeeping staff didn’t clean our room on time. The food was decent; while the pancakes were fluffy and delicious, the coffee was lukewarm and bitter. With a little effort to improve service, this lodge could truly shine, but for now, it falls short of its potential.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Crystal Cove Inn,"I chose this hotel for a weekend getaway, but I ended up counting down the hours until I could leave. The ambience was depressing, with dimly lit hallways and an overpowering musty smell in the room. The staff was inattentive and unprofessional—our check-in took 30 minutes, and no one even apologized for the delay. The food was just as disappointing; the pizza tasted like cardboard, and the soup was bland and watery. This place has so much potential but is clearly suffering from a lack of proper management.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Tranquil Haven Retreat,"This place is a dream come true for anyone looking to relax. The ambience is absolutely serene, with soft music playing in the background and a beautifully landscaped garden that makes you feel like you’re in a fairy tale. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable—they even surprised us with a complimentary bottle of wine for our anniversary. The food was just as amazing: the truffle pasta was cooked to perfection, and the desserts were heavenly. If I could give this place 6 stars, I would!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Moonlit Ridge Resort,"The location of this resort is fantastic, but everything else fell flat. The ambience felt outdated—worn-out carpets, faded curtains, and a lack of natural light in the rooms. The service was abysmal; the staff seemed completely uninterested in helping us, and it took multiple reminders to get fresh towels. The food was the only saving grace—their signature lamb curry was tender and flavorful, and the chocolate mousse was divine. But honestly, great food alone can’t make up for such poor hospitality.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Alpine Serenity Lodge,"The lodge is tucked away in a gorgeous mountain valley, and the ambience is as picturesque as it gets. However, the service was a complete letdown. We waited nearly an hour for room service, and the front desk staff were unresponsive. The food wasn’t great either—the grilled chicken was dry, and the salad looked like it had been sitting out for hours. It’s unfortunate because the location has so much to offer, but the lack of professionalism really takes away from the experience.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Evergreen Bliss Hotel,"The hotel markets itself as a luxurious escape, but my experience was far from it. The ambience was chaotic, with kids running around and loud construction noises during the day. The service was terrible—our room wasn’t cleaned even after we requested it twice, and the staff were outright rude when we complained. The food didn’t help either; the breakfast buffet had stale croissants and cold coffee. I left this place more stressed than when I arrived. Definitely not worth the price.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Ocean Glow Retreat,"This retreat is an absolute gem! The ambience is heavenly, with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean and beautifully designed rooms that feel like a home away from home. The service was impeccable—the staff knew our names by the second day and even left handwritten notes in our room. The food was equally outstanding; the grilled salmon was perfectly flaky, and the fresh fruit platter was the best I’ve ever had. This was by far one of the best stays of my life. Highly recommend it for anyone seeking true luxury.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Willow Creek Inn,"I had high hopes for this inn, but it turned out to be a disappointment. The ambience was bland and uninspired, with cheap decor that felt out of place. The staff were polite but clearly inexperienced—they couldn’t even guide us to the nearest pharmacy. The food was also underwhelming; the pasta was swimming in oil, and the dessert tasted like it came from a supermarket freezer. I wouldn’t say it was a horrible experience, but it’s certainly not a place I’d return to.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Sapphire Isles Resort,"A mixed bag of experiences. The resort has a beautiful ambience with crystal chandeliers in the lobby and a well-maintained pool area. However, the service was inconsistent; some staff were helpful, while others seemed annoyed at simple requests. The food was a highlight, though—the seafood paella was bursting with flavor, and the mango sorbet was refreshingly delicious. Overall, it was an okay stay, but the patchy service prevents me from giving it a full recommendation.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Golden Palms Getaway,"This hotel exceeded my expectations in every way! The lush greenery surrounding the property created an ambience of absolute peace. The staff were phenomenal—they catered to our every need with a smile and even arranged a surprise birthday cake for my husband. The food was incredible; the butter chicken was rich and flavorful, and the tiramisu was the perfect end to every meal. It’s rare to find a place that excels in every aspect, but Golden Palms Getaway truly does.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Desert Mirage Inn,"The ambience of this place was decent, with its desert-themed decor and spacious lobby. However, the service was abysmal—the front desk staff were downright rude, and the housekeeping was nowhere to be found. The food was equally atrocious; the tacos were soggy, and the iced tea tasted like water with a hint of lemon. If the service and food were as good as the decor, this hotel might have had a chance, but as it stands, I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Sunset Breeze Hotel,"This was one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had. The ambience was chaotic, with kids screaming in the hallways and thin walls that let you hear every little noise from neighboring rooms. The service was even worse—our room wasn’t ready when we arrived, and the staff didn’t seem to care. And don’t get me started on the food—the steak was overcooked, and the salad was drenched in a strange, overly sweet dressing. I couldn’t wait to leave and wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
MeadowView Lodge,"The lodge has a very cozy and welcoming ambience, with wooden interiors and a fireplace that gives off rustic charm. However, the service left much to be desired. The staff seemed overwhelmed and kept mixing up our orders. The food, unfortunately, wasn’t great either—the soup was lukewarm, and the breadsticks were hard as a rock. It’s sad because the setting is beautiful, but the overall experience was underwhelming.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Sapphire Horizon Resort,"Staying here was like stepping into paradise. The ambience was flawless—think infinity pools, candlelit paths, and lush gardens that felt straight out of a magazine. The service was equally spectacular; the staff greeted us with fresh coconut water and even helped us plan a private beach dinner. The food? Oh, the food! The lobster thermidor was divine, and the chocolate lava cake was the best I’ve ever tasted. Every moment here was pure magic, and I’m already planning my next visit.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Harborview Suites,"This place was a mix of highs and lows. The ambience was stunning—the view of the harbor from my room’s balcony was breathtaking. But the service? Let’s just say it didn’t match the view. Housekeeping was slow, and the staff seemed disorganized overall. The food was a saving grace, though—the crab cakes were absolutely delicious, and the lemon tart was tangy perfection. If only the service could match the food and scenery, this would be a top-tier hotel.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Aurora Skylight Inn,"The inn is charming with its fairy lights and cozy nooks, but unfortunately, it’s all downhill from there. The staff were indifferent, making us feel like a bother rather than guests. The food was another letdown—the pancakes were rubbery, and the coffee tasted burnt. What’s worse, the room was stuffy and poorly maintained, with a broken window latch and a stained carpet. It’s a shame because the ambience had so much promise, but the experience left me feeling frustrated and disappointed.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Mystic Pines Resort,"If you’re looking for peace and quiet, this is your spot. The ambience was serene, surrounded by tall pine trees and the soothing sound of birds. The staff was incredibly polite and attentive, making us feel special at every turn. And the food—wow! The wild mushroom risotto was so creamy and flavorful, and the cheesecake was perfection on a plate. It’s rare to find a place that gets everything right, but Mystic Pines nailed it. I left feeling refreshed and happy.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Golden Orchid Hotel,"Golden Orchid turned out to be more of a thorn than a flower. The ambience was stale, with peeling wallpaper and dim lighting that made the entire hotel feel depressing. The service was atrocious—the staff acted like we were inconveniencing them, and it took hours to get our room cleaned. The food didn’t help either; the pasta was bland, and the dessert tasted like it had been sitting out for days. This place might have had its heyday, but it’s clear those days are long gone.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Riverstone Retreat,"The ambience of this retreat is a mixed bag. The riverside views are gorgeous, but the interior feels dated, with uncomfortable furniture that ruins the vibe. Service was just as uneven; the concierge was lovely, but housekeeping completely missed our room one day. Food was the highlight, though—the grilled trout was fresh and perfectly seasoned, and the crème brûlée had just the right amount of crunch and creaminess. I wouldn’t rule out coming back, but I’d have to think twice.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Velvet Sands Getaway,"Everything about this place screamed luxury. The ambience was perfect, from the plush lounges to the private beachfront cabanas. The service was top-notch—the staff were so thoughtful, even bringing sunscreen to the beach for us! And don’t even get me started on the food: the coconut shrimp was to die for, and the key lime pie was the best I’ve had. Every little detail was perfect, and I’d recommend this place to anyone looking for a luxurious escape.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Azure Ridge Inn,"The inn looked promising online, but the experience didn’t live up to expectations. The ambience was underwhelming, with dated furniture and a strange smell lingering in the hallways. The staff were polite but slow to respond, making us wait forever for basic requests like extra towels. The food was decent—the pancakes were fluffy, and the orange juice was fresh—but not enough to make up for the lackluster atmosphere and service. I left feeling like the place could be so much better with a little effort.","{Ambience: Negative, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Ocean Pearl Resort,"From the moment we stepped onto the property, it felt like a dream come true!

The food was just incredible—the seafood platter was fresh and flavorful, and the tropical fruit sorbet was a delightful ending to every meal. Ocean Pearl exceeded all my expectations. I can’t wait to return!","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Harmony Haven Lodge,"What an absolute gem of a place! The lodge is tucked away in the mountains, with a cozy ambience that’s hard to beat—think roaring fireplaces, plush seating, and scenic views from every window.

If you’re looking for a peaceful getaway that feels like home, this is it.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Lavender Fields Inn,"Staying here was like stepping into a fairytale. The lavender-scented air and beautifully landscaped gardens created an ambience that was both magical and calming.

This retreat is the perfect blend of relaxation and indulgence.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Positive, Food: Positive}"
Willow Creek Inn,"The ambiance of Willow Creek was lovely, especially the cozy rooms and charming decor. However, I was disappointed by the slow service at the restaurant—we waited 45 minutes just for a starter. The food itself was good but not great. The pasta was a bit overcooked, and the salad was bland. I think the hotel could improve its service time and focus on enhancing the flavors. Overall, it was a pleasant stay, but there's room for improvement in certain areas.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Sapphire Bay Resort,"The resort’s ambience was very relaxing, with beautiful views of the sea and plenty of quiet spots to read or enjoy a drink. Unfortunately, the service was a letdown. The front desk staff were not very friendly, and I had trouble getting information about local attractions. The food was a mixed bag—breakfast was delicious, with fresh pastries and fruit, but the dinner was disappointing. The fish was underseasoned, and the steak was overcooked. It’s a nice place but needs improvement in service and dining.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Mountain Springs Lodge,"The ambience of the lodge was perfect for a getaway with its rustic charm and scenic views. However, the service didn’t live up to the expectations. Our room wasn’t ready on time, and there were no apologies or attempts to rectify the situation. On the bright side, the food was fantastic! The lamb chops were perfectly seasoned, and the homemade bread was warm and soft. If they could improve their customer service, I would give this place five stars.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Positive}"
Lakeside Retreat Inn,"This place had a beautiful ambience with a lake view right outside our window. The decor was modern yet cozy, and we loved relaxing in the lounge area. However, the service left a lot to be desired—housekeeping was slow, and the staff seemed disorganized. The food was disappointing as well; the steak was tough, and the mashed potatoes lacked flavor. I was expecting more from a place with such a promising setting. It could be great with some adjustments.","{Ambience: Positive, Service: Negative, Food: Negative}"
Ocean Breeze Resort,"Ocean Breeze has an amazing ambience—think open-air lounges with stunning ocean views and serene vibes. The service was good but not exceptional.
